class Secret:
    """Encapsulates secrets to avoid them being shown in Robot Framework logs.

    The typical usage is using this class in `library keyword type hints`__ to
    indicate that only :class:`Secret` values are accepted. How to create these
    objects in the data and elsewhere is explained in the `User Guide`__.

    The encapsulated value is available in the :attr:`value` attribute, and it
    is mainly meant to be accessed by library keywords. Values are not hidden
    or encrypted, so they are available for all code that can access these
    objects directly or indirectly via Robot Framework APIs.

    The string representation of this class does not disclose encapsulated
    values, so they are not visible in logs even if these objects themselves
    are logged. Notice, though, that if a keyword passes the actual value
    further, it may be logged or otherwise disclosed later.

    This class should be imported via the :mod:`robot.api.types` module.
